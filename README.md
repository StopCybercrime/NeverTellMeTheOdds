# NeverTellMeTheOdds
The attached files illustrate one of the mechanisms by which the intelligence community spies on private citizens on behalf of corporations. While I discovered these in the Privacy->Analytics &amp; Improvements->Analytics Data directory on my 4th Gen iPad Air, we have found similar .ips files on iPhones including the 13, 13 Pro, and 13 Pro Max; the corruption has persisted even after updating to iOS 15.5 with a brand new phone out of the box and only connected via SIM. However, analagous methods relying upon an array of RF transmission vectors as well as Java-, Python-, and XML-based scripts and package installers have led to compromised Android phones (Galaxy A03s, Galaxy S22 Ultras, Google Pixel 6) as well as now remotely administered Macbook Pros and Surface Laptop Gos. All devices have exhibited zero-click kernel penetration with persistence. Our safety has been in jeopardy through no fault or wrongdoing of our own, but rather only for discovering the surveillance methods directed toward us. I believe in this community and we need your help. If anyone can provide forensic attestation or opine on the attached code we would be beyond grateful. We have been fighting an uphill battle, but together we can put a stop to such egregious violations of one's privacy and civil rights. This is only the beginning.
